PWA Icons Required

To complete PWA setup, you need to create icon files:

1. pwa-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. pwa-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can:
- Use an online icon generator
- Create them in an image editor
- Use a diary/journal themed icon

Place these files in the /public directory.

For now, the app will work without icons, but they're recommended for a better install experience.
